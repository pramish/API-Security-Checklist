## API Security checklist

## Who should use this checklist?

This checklist is intended for **designers**, **developers** and **architects** who are involved in the design of a **web service** or **API**.

## Why do we need this checklist?

The purpose of this checklist is to **audit** an API or web service **prior to** launch, to ensure it is **secure** against the OWASP top 10.

## How do I use this checklist?

This checklist is intended to be **used in conjunction** with the [OWASP API Security Top 10](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x11-t10/). Each item in the checklist is a reference to a corresponding item in the OWASP top 10.
